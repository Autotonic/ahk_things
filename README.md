2. `fsend` Send F13+ keys after a short delay, useful for gaming mice/keyboards where you can reassign keys, ideally these are used for push2talk or something so you dont interfere with anything else. Note: In the case of atleast Razer Synapse 2.0, the GUI shows the key as blank, but it does exist.
