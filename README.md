Various [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) things

1. `appify` Create a desktop shortcut for a Chrome(ium) standalone application [(download exectuable here)](https://github.com/Autotonic/ahk_things/releases/download/v0.2/appify.exe)
2. `fsend` Send F13+ keys after a short delay, useful for gaming mice/keyboards where you can reassign keys, ideally these are used for push2talk or something so you dont interfere with anything else. Note: In the case of atleast Razer Synapse 2.0, the GUI shows the key as blank, but it does exist.
